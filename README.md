# Social-Graphs-and-Interaction

Final project of the exam Social Graphs and Interaction offered by the Technical University of Denmark.
Our focus was to study a dataset of movies, and users rating movies. For many movies there were also some tags describing it.
We applied the methods we learnt during the course of network science and NLP in order to create communities of users and a sentiment analysis over the tags.
